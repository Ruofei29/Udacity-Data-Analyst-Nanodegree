# P1: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

## Background
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

## Hypothese Test
In this project, I used one-tailed dependent t-test to see whether there is statistically siginificant difference between the performance of congruent and incongruent task.
In the end, I rejected the null hypothese based on p-value.
