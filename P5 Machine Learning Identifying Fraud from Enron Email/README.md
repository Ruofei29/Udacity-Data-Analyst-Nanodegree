# P5: Machine Learning Identifying Fraud from Enron Email

## Project Overview
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. In this project, you will play detective, and put your new skills to use by building a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. To assist you in your detective work, we've combined this data with a hand-generated list of persons of interest in the fraud case, which means individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.

## Report
In this project, I've done Data Exploration and Outlier Investigation, Feature Engineering and Selection and Model Selection and Tuning. I've used Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and AdaBoost to train the model and finally selected Naive Bayes model, which showed Accuracy: 0.84677; Precision: 0.50312; Recall: 0.32300.
